# Helix\{\} – Universal AI Design Pattern Code of Conduct (v1)

Helix\{\}™ – Universal AI Design Pattern for Dual-Partner Incremental Redesign (v1) is an open framework for collaborative, AI-assisted decision-making. It combines structured proposals, dual-design partners [2], and schema-validated JSON contracts to ensure clarity, accountability, and traceability in complex decisions.

**Helix\{\}™ is a collaboration rooted in rigor and respect.**
